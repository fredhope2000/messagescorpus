#Read Me for Messages Corpus Bash and R scripts

Bash script:

- edit the mkdir and cd lines of the script near the beginning; it should be the path you want the converted XML files to be stored
- you can leave the "cd /" line alone, it's just a safety catch
- usage: ./convertichatsv1 /path/to/message/logs

R script:

- edit the lines near the end (starting at line 800) with your name, email, same path to the XML files as you entered in the Bash script, and any duplicate names of contacts (see comments in R script)
